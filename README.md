## Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project trains a logistic model on a dataset of 1.6 million Twitter posts to predict whether some text is positive or negative. The app that uses the model can be found at https://nlp-twitter-sentiment.herokuapp.com/

## Motivation
This is a final project for MA346 - Data Science at Bentley University. I wanted to build something that could classify text by drawing some meaning from words and came across this dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140. Additionally, I built this app to gain experience with some Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques as well as some web scraping.

## Features
The app created in this project allows a user to enter some text, or the URL to a specific Twitter post. The model is then applied to the text or Tweet, and classifies it as either having a positive or negative sentiment. It also displays all of the words from the text entered in green if it is a "positive word", red if it is a "negative word", and black if the word is not seen in the dataset or seen the same amount in positive and negative tweets.
